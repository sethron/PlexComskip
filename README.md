# PlexComskip

Modified to work as a Recording Post Process script for DVR settings in Jellyfin, and to add transcoding after comskip to basic mp4 with only video and single stereo audio stream for universal Direct Play performance on LAN. Handbrake strips out any closed captions or text in the primary video stream leaving just a clean video and audio stream, which suits my needs.
